        <h1>Penne Pasta Recipe</h1>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>There are many theories to where pasta originally came from. Some say it was first made in Italy, but that's <u><b>not</b></u> true. Pasta was first made in China in 1700-1100 BC during the Shang Dynasty. This was confirmed in 2005 when archaeologists found a 4000 year old bowl of pasta in Lajia, China. Pasta in China back then was made from wheat or rice flour. Other places like Greece and Africa also have differnet variations of pasta. Pasta was first brought to Italy when Marco Polo came back from his trip to China on the Silk Road. He tried it in China and liked it so much that he decided to bring it back to Italy with him. Today pasta from Italy is made from durum wheat because it is easy to store and doesn't go bad.</p>
        <p><u><b><i>Penne</i></b></u> was first made in Liguria, Italy in the 19th century when a person named Giovanni Battista Capurro made a machine that could cut pasta without breaking it. This allowed people to make all kinds of shapes of pasta including penne. Penne is a hollow cylinder-shaped noodle with pointed ends. The sides of the pasta can either be smooth or grooved.</p>
